Info: The design top_level_model.adb was last modified by software version 11.8.0.26.
Opened an existing Libero design top_level_model.adb.
While analyzing gated clock network, ambiguities have been found on gates
mReceiver/outputData_RNI080B[4]:Y, mReceiver/outputData_RNI2I0M[5]:Y,
mReceiver/outputData_RNI6E0B[7]:Y, mReceiver/outputData_RNI4C0B[6]:Y,
mReceiver/outputData_RNIOVVA[0]:Y, mReceiver/outputData_RNII10M[1]:Y,
mReceiver/outputData_RNIU50B[3]:Y, mReceiver/outputData_RNIS30B[2]:Y.
The timing models of these gates have been simplified for Static Timing Analysis.
Info: Combinational loops have been detected in the design.
